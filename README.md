## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Building

### Pre-built Executable
1. Download the latest release from the releases page
2. Run `DiskCleaner.exe`
3. Allow administrator privileges when prompted

### Building from Source

#### Prerequisites
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2019+ or Build Tools
- Windows SDK 10.0 or later

#### Build Steps
```batch
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DiskCleaner.git
cd DiskCleaner

# Build the project
build.bat

# Run the executable
DiskCleaner.exe
```

The `build.bat` script includes:
- Animated build progress indicator
- Optimized compilation flags
- Error handling and cleanup

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### GUI Mode (Default)
1. **Launch the application** - Run `DiskCleaner.exe`
2. **Review cleanup items** - Check/uncheck items in the list
3. **Select options**:
   - **Dry Run**: Preview changes without deleting
   - **Verbose**: Enable detailed logging
4. **Start cleanup** - Click "Start Cleanup" button
5. **Monitor progress** - Watch the progress bar and results area

### Adding Custom Directories
1. Go to **File ‚Üí Add Directory...**
2. Browse and select the directory to add
3. The directory will appear with a üîß icon
4. Custom directories are automatically saved

### Removing Custom Directories
1. Select a custom directory (marked with üîß)
2. Go to **File ‚Üí Remove Selected Directory**
3. Confirm the removal

## ‚ö° Performance Features

### TURBO Mode (v2.3.0+)
- **Detached threading** - All cleanup tasks run in parallel
- **Maximum thread utilization** - Uses hardware_concurrency() √ó 2 threads
- **100ms polling** - Fast progress updates without blocking
- **Atomic counters** - Thread-safe progress tracking
- **15-second timeout** - Prevents hanging on problematic directories

### Optimization Techniques
- **Pre-filtering** - Skips empty/inaccessible directories
- **Batch processing** - Efficient file deletion in batches
- **Minimal error checking** - Optimized for speed during deletion
- **Fast size calculation** - Parallel directory size computation

## üîß Configuration

### Custom Directories File
Custom directories are stored in `custom_dirs.txt` with the format:
```
Directory Name|Full Path|Description|Enabled(1/0)
```

### Version System
Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[SUFFIX]`
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes or major features
- **MINOR**: Significant new features
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes and improvements
- **SUFFIX**: Hotfixes ("a", "b", "c") or stable ("")

## üìä Technical Architecture

### Threading Model
- **Main Thread**: UI updates and user interaction
- **Worker Threads**: Parallel file deletion and size calculation
- **Detached Threads**: Background cleanup operations
- **Mutex Protection**: Thread-safe logging and progress updates

### Safety Features
- **Dry Run Mode**: Complete simulation without file deletion
- **Administrator Checks**: Automatic privilege elevation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of access denied errors
- **Timeout Protection**: Prevents infinite hangs

### File Operations
- **Parallel Deletion**: Multiple threads for maximum I/O throughput
- **Atomic Progress**: Thread-safe progress reporting
- **Error Recovery**: Continue operation despite individual file failures

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Buttons not responding:**
- Ensure you're running the latest version (v2.4.0b+)
- The WM_COMMAND handling was fixed in recent versions

**Cleanup gets stuck:**
- Version 2.3.0+ includes timeout protection
- Tasks automatically abandon after 15 seconds

**Permission errors:**
- Run as Administrator for system file access
- The application will prompt for elevation automatically

**Custom directories not saving:**
- Ensure the application has write permissions in its directory
- Check that `custom_dirs.txt` exists and is writable

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging to see detailed operation information:
1. Check "Verbose" option before cleanup
2. Monitor the results area for detailed logs
3. Report any errors with the verbose output
